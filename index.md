This is a tribute to Pac-Man, the classic game from 1980. This project is done by students from CITM.

## About the game

Pac-Man is a maze game developed for arcades by Namco and released in Japan on May 21, 1980. The game consists in the player controlling Pac-Man through a maze with the goal of consuming all the dots scattered across the maze while avoiding four ghost enemies attempting to hunt the player down. Once all the dots are consumed, the player advances to the following level, increasing the difficulty of the game until Pac-Man loses three lives (losing one each time the player is caught by a ghost) causing the game to end.
